# ChatSystem

This is Ruby on Rails API allows authenticated users to create new applications.

* Each application has a token(generated by the system); which is the identifier that devices use to send chats to that
 application, and a name(provided by the client). 

* Each application can have many chats, 
and each chat has a number which is returned in 
the creation request.

* A chat contains messages,
and each message has a number which is returned in 
the creation request.

  post 'applications', to: 'applications#create'
  get 'applications/:token', to: 'applications#show'
  put 'applications/:token', to: 'applications#update'
  delete 'applications/:token', to: 'applications#destroy'
  
  #Chats Endpoints
  get 'applications/:token/chats', to: 'chats#index'
  post 'applications/:token/chats', to: 'chats#create'
  get 'applications/:token/chats/:chat_number', to: 'chats#show'
  put 'applications/:token/chats/:chat_number', to: 'chats#update'

  get 'search', to: 'chat_messages#search'
```

## Search Messages

You can search through messages of a specific chat 
and partially match messagesâ€™ bodies.

This is achieved using Elasticsearch with 2 indices, 
one for the `message_body` and the other for the `chat_id`.

```
GET /search?chat_id=id&query=msg
```

## Job queues

Two jobs for the chat and message creation were done in order to handle race conditions and to minimize the queries 
and avoid writing directly to MySQL while serving the 
requests, and use REDIS-SERVER to store temporarily.

ActiveJob `perform_later` was used to enqueue a job to be 
performed as soon as the queuing system is free.

## CronJob

And using Sidekiq-cron, a cronjob is scheduled every hour 
to count and persist column `chats_number` in the applications 
table, and the `messages_number` in the chats table.
